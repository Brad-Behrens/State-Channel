# State-Channel
Proof-of-concept implementation of state channel technology to be deployed on the Ethereum network as a second-layer scaling solution.

The solution aimed to minimise the amount of on-chain transactions by allowing a set of partcipants to collectively update the state of an application via the exchange of digital signatures of the hash of the applications state. This allowed state updated to be performed without the submission of on-chain transactions whilst ensuring the finality of the set of state updates executed between the participants.
